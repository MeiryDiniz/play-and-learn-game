## Unfixed Bugs

There aren't any bugs to be fixed.

## Fixed Bugs

 - When I published the website game the game area page was not loading when the Pay ``button`` was clicked beacause I used the wrong path to have access to this file.

**Wrong** 
`../gamearea.html`

**Correct** 
`gamearea.html`

- I also had problem with the functions because of the correct position of `()`, `{}`, and `[]`. I had to take a break, revise the course content and testing the different ways to figure out mistakes.
